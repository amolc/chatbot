                        <p>“To ensure the plane and crew you’re getting are up to snuff, ask for an Argus TripCHEQ or Wyvern PASS report, offered by the two largest private jet safety firms — Argus International Inc. and Wyvern Consulting Ltd. — which audit charter companies and conduct background checks on crew members, making sure pilots have the requisite number of flying hours for the specific type of aircraft. Either your jet sourcing company or the private jet company itself (if you’re booking directly) should be able to provide this.” – WSJ</p>
