                        <p>“Business aviation reaches 10 times the number of U.S. airports (over 5,000 public-use facilities) than the airlines do. The majority of U.S. airline flights only go to and from 70 major airports, and the total number of U.S. destinations served by air carriers has declined.” – NBAA</p>
