For our Elite Members, world travel is flying private to places which afford exotic experiences. Whether you’re flying one way island hopping to remote and private locales or traveling from Dubai to Bangladesh, we take you to places commercial airlines can’t service and that require days of conventional travel to access.</p>

                            <p>Companies that fly private over commercial save hundreds of hours in travel overhead time; allowing high level execs to maximize their shareholder value by reaching more meetings, on time, anywhere in the world. Private aviation is valuable to meet your schedule and travel to destinations not served by commercial aviation. Private aircraft get you almost anywhere in the world as fast as possible, with no frustrating wait times in line, airport hang-ups, long walks, airport parking hassles, layovers, or inefficient routes. Fly at times, and under conditions that commercial airlines would never permit. Whether you are a CEO, high level management team, professional athlete, high profile celebrity or family—private aviation offers the maximum in efficiency, privacy, comfort, and convenience.</p>
